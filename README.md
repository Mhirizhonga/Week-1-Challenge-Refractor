# Week-1-Challenge-Refractor
My response for Week 1's challenge focused on optimisation

//The first thing I fixed was the <a> element for 'Search Engine Optimization'

// Secondly added some 'alt' text for each image incase images do not load or a screen reader is deployed

// <! Followed HTML semantics to ensure that 'h3' only came on after 'h2' element>

// <! Corrected the '.footer h4' selector to ensure it corresponded with the 'h4' footer elemenent in HTML>
